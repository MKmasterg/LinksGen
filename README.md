# LinksGen
My note:
Well I desperately needed this program so I coded myself. basically input first and second links and the program will automatically generates valid links based on that pattern. 

Requirements:
-Python3
-Python Requests

How it works:

The program is used for those of links that have a certain pattern, for example : 
link 1 = https://example.com/content_part1.mp4
link 2 = https://example.com/content_part2.mp4
and so forth

as you can see the pattern is basically ....content_partX.mp4 , so the program based on the pattern will generate valid links.

How to use:

It's easy! just put first link and secoond link and the program will do the thing! after that, copy all the links and use "IDM's batch download" for adding the links to the list.
